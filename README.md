# Building a Rest API with Node.js Express Framework 
# Introduction 
- Building a RESTful API.
- Performing CRUD operations.
- Writing API endpoints.

# Step 1
Use Node.js and Express to build an API that performs CRUD operations on users.
1. Run in terminal "npm init" to initialize Node package manager(NPM). It creates a default json file called package.json
2. Create a new file index.js and write in the terminal "npm install --save express" to install Express 
3. Listen the code on local host 3000 
Add a server script to the package.json that runs the API using nodemon.
